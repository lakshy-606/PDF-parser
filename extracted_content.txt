Welcome to the Maryland 2024 Tax Year Booklet

[PAGE: 2] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Reflecting on the first two years of a four-year term, I am proud that our team has worked to modernize our agency and engage with Marylanders. We launched Maryland Tax Connect - a new and improved self-service portal for business tax filing and our agency’s first-ever report on the State of the Economy! This year’s rotation of covers highlights some of Maryland’s unique cultural institutions, showcasing our state’s museums that preserve its rich history and culture. While we couldn’t feature all the incredible museums to visit across Maryland, we proudly cel- ebrate these three treasured institutions. Read below to learn more and send us your ideas on the attributes that make Maryland special that we should highlight in the coming years!

[PAGE: 2] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Founded by Anna Brugh Singer and her husband William H. Singer, Jr. in Hagerstown, Maryland, the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts opened its doors in 1931 and expanded twice - in 1949 and 1994. The firm Hyde & Shepherd designed the building in the neo-Georgian style and features red brick construction trimmed with local limestone. The American Association of Muse- ums accredited the museum in 1997 and it is the only art museum in Western Maryland to hold this honor. The museum’s collection has grown to include over 6,000 art objects.

[PAGE: 2] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was founded in 1965 as a project of the Historical So- ciety of Talbot County, which obtained three waterfront houses along St. Michael Harbor. The museum was once a site for seafood packing houses, docks, and work boats, and it currently houses a wide range of exhibits, artifacts, and vessels from the Chesapeake Bay. The museum has interactive displays that showcase the Bay’s history and physical and economic environ- ments. It makes for a great visit for adults and children alike!

The Baltimore Museum of Industry

[PAGE: 2] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Founded in 1977, the Baltimore Museum of Industry (BMI) interprets the diverse and significant human stories behind labor and innovation in Baltimore, cultivating a sense of belonging and in- spiring visitors to think critically about the intersection of work and society. Located in an 1860s oyster cannery on a five-acre waterfront campus, the BMI offers dynamic indoor and outdoor exhibitions, live demonstrations, tours, and hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. Current exhibitions explore the rise and fall of Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point, labor activism and unions in 21st century Baltimore, and the role of corner bars as social gathering spaces at the turn of the century.

[PAGE: 2] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
The Francis Scott Key Bridge spanning Baltimore’s Patapsco River carried workers for nearly a half century—to steel mills, sugar refineries, and offices downtown. When it collapsed on March 26, 2024, it was being repaired by middle-of-the-night laborers filling potholes so Marylanders would have a safer ride to their jobs. In response, the museum has launched an oral history project to preserve the stories of people whose livelihoods have been impacted by the bridge collapse. The stories and materials collected will form the basis of public programs and a future long-term exhibition at the BMI about the Port, its history, and the jobs it sustains.

A MESSAGE FROM THE COMPTROLLER

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Dear Marylander,

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to review our 2024 Maryland State Tax Forms and Instructions. We compile this publication each year to help guide Marylanders through the tax filing process and provide updates on tax code changes.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Our team at the Office of the Comptroller has been hard at work over the last year to begin an important revitalization in the agency. Guided by our agency-wide vision — to work in partnership to create a state that is more equitable, more resilient, and more prosperous so that every Marylander can reach their full potential — we set forth an ambitious agenda to modernize the agency and our infrastructure, obtain much-needed resources to better serve Marylanders throughout the state, and ensure Maryland is well-positioned for responsible long term economic growth and success.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
The Comptroller’s Office released the agency's inaugural State of the Economy Report in January, using economic data from 2023. My team led this collaborative effort to better understand the forces at play that have led the state to receive less revenue in the past year. Future reports will dive into specific areas uncovered by our findings. You can find all our research reports at marylandtaxes.gov/research to learn more.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
As part of a much-needed modernization effort, we have launched Maryland Tax Connect, a self-service portal that now allows Maryland businesses to file their taxes online with increased ease and security, enabling taxpayers to interact with the Comptroller’s Office more efficiently. The portal is designed to allow taxpayers to complete essential functions and is accessible from a mobile device or a desktop. Our goal is for all Maryland taxpayers to be able to pay their state taxes and track their tax payments in this new system by 2026. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov/MDTaxConnect.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Additionally, during the 2025 tax season, eligible Marylanders will be able to file their state and federal taxes for free through the new Direct File program. Direct File is a new, simple, and secure tax filing software developed by the IRS in partnership with the Comptroller of Maryland, which will allow eligible taxpayers to prepare and file their tax returns online, directly with the government. Visit marylandtaxes.gov/directfile to learn more about this and other options available for Marylanders to file their taxes this year.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
lam also pleased to report that we had another successful legislative session this past year. With broad stakeholder support, and in partnership with Governor Wes Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson, and Speaker Adrienne Jones, we obtained additional resources for the Comptroller’s Office, including new positions to advance hiring efforts across the agency and $8.5 million for cybersecurity, training, audit efforts, equipment upgrades, maintenance, fraud, and accessibility-related projects, including translation services.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
We also passed all six of our priority bills in our legislative package. Over the long term, these bills will help Marylanders by providing tax assistance funding for low-income residents of Maryland, supporting our agency’s compliance efforts, preventing and punishing tax preparer scams, promoting online filing, and providing resources to help raise awareness of personal income tax credits.

[PAGE: 3] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
We look forward to working with you, your community, or your business. Only by building solid partnerships can we ensure the growth and thriving of our communities and businesses. Please call our team for assistance at 1-800-MD-TAXES or email us at taxhelp@marylandtaxes.gov.

TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RETURN

[PAGE: 9] [TYPE: ListItem]
a. Add up all of your federal gross income to determine your total federal income. Gross income is defined in the Internal Revenue Code and, in general, consists of all income regard- less of source. It includes wages and other compensation for services, gross income derived from business, gains (not losses) derived from dealings in property, interest, rents, royalties, dividends, alimony, annuities, pensions, income from partnerships or fiduciaries, etc. If modifications or deductions reduce your gross income below the mini- mum filing level, you are still required to file. IRS Pub- lication 525 provides additional information on taxable and nontaxable income.

[PAGE: 9] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
There are severe penalties for failing to file a tax return, failing to pay any tax when due, filing a false or fraudulent return, or making a false certification. Penalties may include civil fines, criminal fines, imprisonment, and a penalty on your taxes. In addition, interest is charged on amounts not paid.

[PAGE: 10] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
The Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 423 in the 2019 Session requiring the collection of certain information, including whether an individual is uninsured at the time the tax return is filed and whether the individual is interested in having Maryland Health Connection (“MHC”) determine whether an individual may be eligible for insurance affordability programs, such as no-cost or low-cost minimum essential health care coverage.

[PAGE: 10] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Check the appropriate box on Form 502 for you and/or your spouse if you are uninsured as of the date you file your return. If you would like MHC to determine pre-eligibility for health in- surance affordability programs for any uninsured member of your household, you must also check the box on Form 502 indi- cating you authorize the Comptroller to share information from your tax return with MHC, which is operated by the Maryland

SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER(S) (SSN).

[PAGE: 10] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
It is important that you enter each digit of your Social Security number in the space provided at the top of your tax return. Missing or unreadable digits will delay the processing of your return. Your name must match the name on your current Social Security card to ensure you receive your personal exemption. If your name does not match the name on your Social Security card, contact the federal Social Security Administration at 800-722-1213, or visit ssa.gov.

[PAGE: 10] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
The Social Security number(s) must be a valid number issued by the Social Security Administration of the United States Gov- ernment. If you, your spouse, or dependent(s) do not have a Social Security number and you are not eligible to get a SSN, you must apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) with the IRS and you should wait until you have received it before you file; and enter it wherever your Social Security number is requested on the return.

[PAGE: 11] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
A missing or incorrect SSN or ITIN could result in the disallow- ance of any credits or exemptions you may be entitled to and result in a balance due.

Fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address of the taxing area as of December 31, 2024, including political subdivision lines, based on your residence on the last day of the taxable period. Part-year residents fill in the lines for your Maryland physical ad- dress, including political subdivision lines, based on your last day of residence in Maryland in the taxable period. Military personnel who are legal residents of Maryland should fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines,

[PAGE: 11] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
When selecting the 4 Digit Political Subdivision Code, be sure that you have selected the proper political subdivi- sion from the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND. Do not rely on your ZIP Code + 4 to identify the proper political subdivision. For example, most residents within the ZIP Code of Upper Marlboro do not reside in the political subdivision of the Town of Upper Marlboro. Therefore, entering the Town of Upper Marlboro on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line for those with a ZIP Code in Upper Marlboro may not be correct. Also, some political subdivisions have similar names such as Bel Air in Allegany County and Town of Bel Air in Harford County or Town of Chevy Chase and Town of Chevy Chase View. You may contact your county seat for further information relating to the incor- porated boundaries of incorporated cities, towns, and taxing areas in your county.

The personal exemption is $3,200. This exemption is reduced once the taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($150,000 if filing Joint, Head of Household, or Qualifying Surviving Spouse with Dependent Child). This reduction applies to the additional dependency exemptions as well; however, it does not apply to the taxpayer’s age or blindness exemption of $1,000. Use the chart to determine the allowable exemption amount based upon the filing status. NOTE: For certain taxpayers with interest from U.S. obligations see Instruction 13, Line 13, code hh for applicable exemption adjustment.

If you itemized your deductions on the joint federal return, one spouse may use the standard deduction and the other spouse may claim those deductions on the federal return that are “at- tributable exclusively” to that spouse, plus a prorated amount of the remaining deductions. If it is not possible to determine these deductions, the deduction must be allocated proportion- ately based on your share of the income.

[PAGE: 13] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
“Attributable exclusively” means that the individual is solely responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an item- ized deduction, including compliance with a valid court order or separation agreement; or the individual jointly responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction can demonstrate payment of the full amount of the deduction with funds that are not attributable in whole or in part, to the other jointly responsible individual.

[PAGE: 13] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If both spouses choose to itemize on their separate Maryland returns, then each spouse must determine which deductions are attributable exclusively to each spouse and prorate the remaining deductions using the Maryland Income Factor. See Instruction 26k. If it is not possible to determine deductions in this manner, they must be allocated proportionately based on their respective shares of the income. The total amount of itemized deductions for both spouses cannot exceed the item- ized deductions on the federal return.

[PAGE: 13] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If you choose to use the standard deduction method, use STAN- DARD DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) in Instruction 16. Each spouse must claim their own personal exemption. Each spouse may allocate the dependent exemptions in any manner they choose. A dependent may not be claimed twice. The total number of depen- dents claimed may not exceed the overall number of dependents.

Pat and Chris Jones had a federal adjusted gross income of $180,000. They also had $40,000 on interest from U.S. Sav- ings Bonds and had a dependent son whom they claimed on the Maryland tax return.

If you claimed an earned income credit on your federal return or would otherwise have been eligible to claim an earned in- come credit on your federal return but for you or your spouse filing with an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), you are eligible for the Maryland earned income credit. If you are a married couple filing either a joint or separate Mary- land return, or you have at least one qualifying child, then you may claim one-half (50%) of the federal credit on your Mary- land return. Individuals filing as single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse without a qualifying child may claim 100% of the federal earned income credit, see Work- sheet (18A.1) to calculate any refundable earned income tax credit. If you are a part-year resident or a member of the mili- tary, see Instruction 26(0) before completing this worksheet. If you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the federal credit and are otherwise eligible for the federal credit for those without a qualifying child, you may claim the state earned income credit (calculate federal earned income credit disregarding the minimum age requirement). If you or your spouse do not possess a valid SSN but are otherwise eligible for the federal credit and are filing your Maryland return us- ing an ITIN, you may claim the state earned income credit by calculating the federal earned income credit disregarding the SSN requirement. If you filed a joint federal return but a separate Maryland return, you may claim a combined total of up to one-half the federal credit.

OVERPAYMENT

[PAGE: 28] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If you file Form 502 and have an overpayment on Line 46, the Revenue Administration Division will refund any amount of $1.00 or more.

If you must pay interest for underpayment of estimated tax, enter the amount of interest from Line 18 of Form 502UP on Line 49. Subtract Lines 47 and 49 from your overpayment (Line 46). This is the amount of your refund. Write this amount on Line 48. No refunds of less than $1.00 will be sent. If the amount on Line 49 is more than the overpayment on Line 46 of Form 502, enter zero (0) on Lines 47 and 48. Then subtract Line 46 from Line 49 and enter the result on Line 50.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Maryland will abate the tax liability for an individual who is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces at death, and dies while in active service in a combat zone or at any place from wounds, dis- ease, or injury incurred while in active service in a combat zone. To obtain an abatement, a return must be filed. The abatement will apply to the tax year in which death occurred, and any earlier tax year ending on or after the first day the member served in a combat zone in active service.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Maryland will also abate the tax liability of an individual who dies while a military or civilian employee of the United States, if such death occurs as a result of wounds or injury incurred outside the United States in a terrorist or military action. In the case of a joint return, Maryland applies the same rules for these taxpay- ers as does the IRS. For more information on filing a return, see Publication 3 Armed Forces Tax Guide available at irs.gov. Place code number 915 on one of the lines marked “code numbers” to the right of the telephone number area, if you are filing a return for a taxpayer who was killed in action meeting the above criteria.

return. If your amended return shows a larger refund, the Reve- nue Administration Division will issue an additional refund check.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: Title]
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Do not file an amended return until sufficient time has passed to allow the original return to be processed. For current year returns, allow at least six weeks.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Generally, a claim for a refund or overpayment credit must be filed within three years from the date the original return was filed or within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. An original return filed early is considered filed on the date it was due. If a claim is filed within three years after the date the original return was filed, the credit or refund may not be more than that part of the tax paid within three years, plus any exten- sion of time for filing the return, immediately preceding the filing of the claim. If a claim is filed after the three year period, but within two years from the time the tax was paid, the refund or credit may not be more than the tax paid within two years im- mediately before filing the claim for a refund or credit.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
A claim for refund based on a federal net operating loss carryback must be filed within three years from the due date of the return for the tax year of the net operating loss (farming loss only).

If the claim for refund resulted from a federal adjustment or final decision of a federal court which is more than three years from the date of filing the return or more than two years from the time the tax was paid, a claim for refund must be filed within one year from the date of the adjustment or final decision.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If the claim for refund resulted from a notification received from another state for income taxes due which is more than three years from the date of filing the Maryland return or more than two years from the time the tax was paid, a claim for refund resulting from a credit for taxes paid to that state must be filed within one year of the date of the notification that the other state’s tax was due.

[PAGE: 32] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If the claim for refund or credit for overpayment resulted from final determination made by an administrative board or an ap- peal of a decision of an administrative board, that is more than three years from the date of filing the return or more than two years from the time the tax was paid, the claim for refund must be filed within one year of the date of the final decision of the ad- ministrative board or final decision of the highest court to which an appeal of the administrative board is taken.

Purpose of declaration. The filing of a declaration of estimated Maryland income tax is a part of the pay-as-you-go plan of income tax collection adopted by the State. If you have any income such as pensions, business income, lottery, capital gains, interest, dividends, etc., from which no tax is withheld, or wages from which not enough Maryland tax is withheld, you may have to pay estimated taxes. The law is similar to the federal law.

A married couple may file a joint declaration. If you are filing a joint declaration, both Social Security numbers must be entered. If filing on behalf of a minor, the name and Social Security number of the minor must be entered.

[PAGE: 53] [TYPE: ListItem]
c. $3,200 for each allowable dependent, other than taxpayer and spouse. The amount is doubled for allowable depen- dents age 65 or over.

[PAGE: 53] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If your FAGI will be more than $100,000, see chart below to determine the amount of exemption you can claim for items a and c above.

[PAGE: 53] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
When to file a declaration. You must pay at least one- fourth of the total estimated tax on Line 15 of this form on or before April 15, 2025. The remaining quarterly payments are due June 15, 2025, September 15, 2025 and January 15, 2026. You may pay the total estimated tax with your first payment. If you are filing on a fiscal year basis, each payment is due by the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 13th months following the beginning of the fiscal year.

[PAGE: 53] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Overpayment of tax. If you overpaid your 2024 income tax (Form 502 or 505), you may apply all or part of the over- payment to your 2025 estimated tax. If the overpayment ap- plied equals or exceeds the estimated tax liability for the first quarterly payment, you are not required to file the declaration. If the overpayment applied is less than the estimated tax liability, you should file the declaration and pay the balance of the first installment.

[PAGE: 53] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
How to estimate your 2025 tax. The worksheet is designed to develop an estimate of your 2025 Maryland and local in- come tax. Be as accurate as you can in forecasting your 2025 income. You may use your 2024 income tax as a guide, but if you will receive more income than you did in 2024, you must pay at least 110% of your prior year tax to avoid interest for underpayment of estimated tax. For the purpose of estimating, rounding all amounts to the nearest dollar is recommended.

Automatic Maryland six-month extension

[PAGE: 55] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
If you filed a federal extension and expect to owe zero tax to Maryland we grant you an automatic six-month extension of time to file your Form 502, 505, 510C, or 515. You are not required to file for an extension in order to obtain this automatic extension. However, you should use Form PV to pay any tax due of forms 502, 505, and 515, but you should use Form EL102B to pay any tax due or payment with extension of Form 510C in order to avoid any late-payment penalty and interest on tax not paid by April 15, 2025.

[PAGE: 55] [TYPE: NarrativeText]
Note: In the case of Form 510C, the PVW must be completed to estimate the payment.

Only include Form PV with Form 502, 505, or 515 if you are filing an extension request along with a payment by check or money order.

Under Maryland law, you may be eligible for a substantial credit on the property tax bill issued on your home, based upon your gross household income. This program is available to homeowners of all ages and the credit is calculated solely on the basis of gross income. The application form is not provided in this income tax booklet because the credits are issued as a deduction from the homeowner’s July property tax bill. The property tax credit application forms are processed separately by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.

Use the chart printed below to see if it would be worthwhile for you to submit a Homeowners’ Tax Credit application. If the actual property taxes on your home (based on no more than $300,000 of assessed value) exceed the “Tax Limit” amount shown on the table below for your household income level, you may be eligible for a credit and are urged to file an application. The table is printed for illustrative purposes, and therefore, the income amounts are listed in increments of $1,000. For purposes of this program, the applicant must report total income, which means the combined gross household income before any deductions are taken. Nontaxable income, such as Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Veterans’ benefits, also must be reported as income for the tax credit program.
